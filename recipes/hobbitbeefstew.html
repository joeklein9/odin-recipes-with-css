    <h1>Hobbit Beef Stew</h1>
    <img src="beefstew.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In the film adaptation of The Two Towers, Samwise Gamgee and Smeagol go head to head in a little battle of culinary preferences, with Smeagol preferring his meals still raw and "wriggling", while Samwise waxes poetic about "lovely big golden chips" (that's fries for us Americans).  It's the love of the spud that launched a thousand internet memes and remixes.

    </p>
    <p>So on this most holy of holidays, I say we pay tribute to Samwise and stick some potatoes in a stew.  Like many people, I spend most of my days at work, so I prefer a stew that can go in the slow cooker and be ready by the end of the day.  Chop up all the vegetables the night before to make things come together even easier in the morning.</p>
