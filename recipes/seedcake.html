    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>"But I don't mind some cake - seed cake, if you have any."</em>-Balin, The Hobbit, An Unexpected Party, page 19.</p>
    <p>The first recipe to be posted here, huzzah! Seed cake is mentioned very early on in the Hobbit, so it seemed a logical place to start.
        The recipe I followed came from an early 20th century copy of Mrs Beaton, it is a very traditional English cake and it is safe to assume that it is the type Tolkien would have been familiar with, though I welcome any discussion on this point.
        The cake turned out well, after a few small issues such as misreading the scales and putting in 100g extra butter. It has a dense, soft texture on the inside and quite a lot of thick, golden, biscuity crust. Delicious with a good, milky tea, sweetened to taste. The cake has a mild licorice flavour from the caraway seeds, but do not be put off if you do not like licorice, it is quite palatable. The cake is robust enough that you could double the amount of caraway seeds and spices, and even throw in a handful of candied citrus peel.</p>

    <li>350g of butter
    </li>

    <li>Add the mace, nutmeg and caraway seeds, mix together well.</li>
